                    <li>&frac12; tsp ground cloves</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Royal icing:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 egg whites</li>
                    <li>200g icing sugar</li>
                    <li>&frac13; tsp liquid glucose</li>
                    <li>&frac13; tsp lemon juice</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <h5>Cookies:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cream the butter for a minute on medium speed, before adding the sugar and molasses.
                        Beat on a higher speed until combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and beat in the egg, as well as the vanilla extract on high
                        speed for 2 minutes.
                        Don't panic if it separates a bit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a different bowl, whisk the flour, baking side, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves
                        and stir them nicely.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add these in with the wet ingredients a little at a time, beating on a low speed.
                        The dough will get nice and thick, keep going until you've mixed in all the dry ingredients.
                    </li>
                    <li>Split the dough into two halves, and shape them into rough discs.
                        Wrap them up in cling film and chill in the fridge overnight (or for at least 3 hours).
                        They can keep for about 3 days if you want to stagger your baking.
                    </li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 180C.</li>
                    <li>Flour a work surface, your hands, and your rolling pin, and roll out one of the cookie dough
                        discs into a 1cm-thick sheet.
                        Pick it up and rotate slightly as you roll in different directions to avoid it sticking to the
                        surface, and cracking too much along the edges.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cut with whatever cookie cutter shapes you have on hand, and place about 2cm apart on a baking
                        tray (with a baking sheet ready).
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake for about 9-10 minutes.
                        Longer baking times tend to produce crunchier cookies, where as shorter times leave them softer
                        and chewier.
                    </li>
                    <li>Allow to cool on a wire rack, and get going on the decorating if your icing is ready!</li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Royal icing:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk the egg white lightly, then add the icing sugar a little at a time.</li>
                    <li>When all the icing sugar has been added, add the glucose and lemon juice too.</li>
                    <li>Keep whisking until the thickness of the icing allows it to hold little peaks.
                        It should be smooth and shiny.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add food colouring if you want to make things more interesting.</li>
                    <li>All done, pipe away!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Makes lots.
