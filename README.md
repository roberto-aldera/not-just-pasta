# not-just-pasta
A web-based recipe book :spaghetti: :book:

[![CI](https://github.com/roberto-aldera/not-just-pasta/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roberto-aldera/not-just-pasta/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Hosted via GitHub pages [here](https://roberto-aldera.github.io/not-just-pasta/).
This is meant to be a fun side project to learn a bit of web development while also getting to build something useful!
It's my first attempt at building a website, so I've tried to keep it simple and learn as I go along.
The whole design is calling for modernisation, so in future I'd like to overhaul things to using proper scripting, instead of manually setting up HTML (it's been a journey ðŸ˜…)

Not all recipes are original, and I've tried to cite sources as best I can.
That being said, we've made changes to many of these dishes to suit personal preferences, so these are not just reproductions of other recipes found online.
Have fun in the kitchen!

## Quick start notes
Run server locally with `php -S localhost:8000` from top-level folder.
